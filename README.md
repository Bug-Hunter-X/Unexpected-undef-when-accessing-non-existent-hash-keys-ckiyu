This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle Perl bug related to accessing hash elements with non-existent keys.  The `bug.pl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a solution to handle such cases gracefully.  The issue stems from Perl's dynamic typing; accessing a non-existent key doesn't throw an error but returns `undef`, often leading to unexpected behavior in the program's logic. The solution emphasizes the use of the defined operator or a conditional check to handle this scenario correctly.
